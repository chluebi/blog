        An interrogation of the nature of self-referential texts.

        Definitions
    </h3>
    <p>
        A work is considered self-referential (colloquially "meta" or "breaking the fourth wall") when the narrative voice shows the ability to
        understand its position as a narrative voice. The word "meta" comes from the meta-level on which such a narrative
        voice is considered to be on, metaphorically elevated and looking down on the text in its entirety.
    </p>
    <h4>
        The Benign Meta
    </h4>>
    <p>
        This paragraph is purely a way of adressing the large majority of texts which use meta-level references in a
        purely utiliarian manner. You mostly find this in non-fiction where an author might need to refer to a previous
        or later section. This is an integral part of literature but also not the focus of this article.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Meta as a Rhetorical Device
    </h4>
    <p>
        I distinguish between this and the previously-mentioned category on a more or less granular scale.
        Arguably everything may be a rhetorical device as long as you analyze it enough.
        What I'm interested in, is any use of self-reference which utilizes this meta-level commentary as an attempt
        to make a larger point about the text or texts in general as a whole.
    </p>
    <h4>
        An Example
    </h4>
    <p>
        A character at the final boss fight might mention that the player could quit the game and never return.
        The game then forcefully closes.
        This is meant to comment on the nature of player agency, namely that the player's agency actually eclipses
        the one of any "character" in the game (although on a technical level, characters in the game and the game 
        itself are indistinguishable).
    </p>
    <p>
        The player's suspension is purposefully broken and if the game has gotten invested the player enough 
        up this point that they return to the game, not because they have some in-game prophecy to fulfill
        but because they as a person have become invested in the game's fiction.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Meta as a Vehicle for Comedy
    </h3>
    <p>
        Cards on the table, I find purely comedic meta references tiring.
        For one, comedy lives from two sources: surprise and affirmation.
        Arguably the second one does not even count as comedy, but it is often referred as "just a joke"
        and has to be therefore adressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Surprise is obviously killed by repetition. This means in my opinion, the only way to have a justified
        comedic meta reference is a singular one, often at the end of a work.
        In practice this means breaking the fourth wall purely for a joke.
        But light-hearted nature of comedy does not gist with the profound nature of opening an entire narrative layer.
        I could theoretically see it as part of a joke which wants to be more than just entertaining, but such are rare
        and I have not seen one use self-referential humor.
    </p>
    <p>
        No, most self-referential bases itself on affirmation. It bets on the fact that a reader/player/consumer
        both understand the reference and considers that a feat worthy of feeling proud of one-self. It is there 
        to envoke a self-congratulatory chuckle. It is whispering to you "we know what's really going on, unlike
        'those people'". It essentially pits the reader of text against the entire world of the text in a discipline
        where the player has an inherent advantage. I think it might even be adequate to call it an extension of
        a power fantasy. But whereas other power fantasies bet on suspension of disbelief, this one bets on the fact
        of a player feeling smart when smashing said suspension.
    </p>
    <h3>
        The Nihilism of Meta
    </h3>
    <p>
        The problem with acknowdling inside of a text, that it is purely a text, is that it breaks ones suspension of
        disbelief. It opens up the question of "if this is just a text, then why should I care?".
        For non-fiction the answer is quite trivial: "This relates to reality."
        But fiction suffers extremly from this. It can seem like the characters or worse the narrator of the entire
        story are not taking the events seriously. The player can even feel mocked for ever having cared about the
        world. The only driving force left is often the inherent attraction a text can have on a player.
        The text just actually has to be worthwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
        But there exists another possibility: fiction can have a lot to do with reality. This seems paradoxical if
        one sees these two things as opposites, but really they are nested subjects.
        Fiction <b>exists</b> inside of a reality, mostly as texts.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Meta as a Tool for Exploring the Fundamental Nature of Texts
    </h3>
    <p>
        This is where, in my opinion, the true strength of self-referential content lies.
        Mentioning that the text exists in its own context allows us to engage with said context in new ways.
        It can not only make a reader think why a particular element of a text exists, but direct this thinking
        in new ways, by playing with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a reader's attention is taken by these questions, they are able to recognize not only the text, but
        their own engagement with the text. Being able to lie to a reader and call their attention to said lie,
        will make them weary of the authority of texts in general. "If I didn't tell you, you'd still believe it".
        Meta as such is invaluable for advancing "advanced literacy", meaning knowledge of not only the Fundamental
        tools of communication but also the larger structures.
